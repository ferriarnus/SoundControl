# Sound Control Keys
A client side only mods gives you keybinds so you can quickly mute/unmute or increase/decrease the master sound level.

No longer do you  need to navigate the options menu looking for the slider!

When changing the volume, in the top right corner the current volume will be presented as an percentage.

Currently only works for master volume, but more to come !!
